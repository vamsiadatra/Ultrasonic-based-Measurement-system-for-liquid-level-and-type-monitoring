Maintaining an adequate amount of fluid intake is critical in both physical and  cognitive wellness and health. Prior research emphasizes the serious physical and cognitive  consequences of dehydration, as well as the preventive care benefits of taking a sufficient  amount of fluid.

To develop a viable solution for ubiquitous monitoring of fluid intake, it is essential 
to monitor the type of consumed fluid, because different fluids have different hydrating 
capabilities depending on their electrolyte and glucose contents. In other words, the suggested 
amount of fluid intake may vary depending on the beverage type. Furthermore, identification 
of the fluid type could be effective in monitoring the user’s cheating behaviors on the 
prescribed/recommended regimen (e.g., drinking sugar-sweetened high-calorie beverages) or 
tracking one’s calorie intake from fluid consumption. For instance, prior research reported 
that individuals consume, on average, 10%–15% of their total daily calories from sugar 
sweetened beverages. Hence, the development of a personalized tracking solution for fluid 
intake—in terms of both the volume and the type is in great need to assist users to achieve 
their hydration goals in everyday living situations.
In this, we introduce a Liquid Intake Detection System a mobile sensor system 
attached to the lid of a reusable water bottle (e.g., a tumbler) from inside, capable of 
automatically monitoring fluid intake volume, type, and temperature. The proposed system 
also detects important activities related to fluid intake, such as drinking from the bottle and 
opening the lid, which enables the opportunistic but continuous monitoring of the target fluid 
volume and type, further optimizing the power consumption of the embedded system. LIDS 
consists of several sensor modalities including an ultrasonic sensor, an RGB (Red, Green, and 
Blue) colour sensor, a temperature sensor, and an accelerometer. These sensors are coupled 
with an ultra-low power micro-controller and a wireless module for real-time sensor data 
sampling, processing, and transmission.
